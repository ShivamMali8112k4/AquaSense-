# üöÄ Working of SmartWaterMonitor

## üåä How the Water Level Monitoring System Works

The **SmartWaterMonitor** is an IoT-based water level monitoring system that uses an **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**, **NodeMCU ESP8266**, and **Blynk Cloud** for real-time monitoring and motor control. Below is a detailed breakdown of how it functions.

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Working Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Water Level Detection**
- The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** is placed at the top of the water tank.
- It continuously sends **ultrasonic pulses** to measure the distance between the sensor and the water surface.
- The time taken for the echo to return is converted into a **distance measurement** (in cm).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Processing by NodeMCU**
- The **distance value** is sent to the **NodeMCU ESP8266**, which calculates the **water level percentage**.
- The water level is compared against pre-defined thresholds to determine if the tank is **empty, low, medium, high, or full**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual Indicators (LEDs)**
- Based on the water level, **LEDs** indicate the current status:
  - **Very Low Level** ‚Üí Only 1 LED ON
  - **Low Level** ‚Üí 2 LEDs ON
  - **Medium Level** ‚Üí 3 LEDs ON
  - **High Level** ‚Üí 4 LEDs ON
  - **Full Tank** ‚Üí All 5 LEDs ON

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Blynk App Integration**
- The **Blynk app** displays the real-time **water level percentage**.
- Data is transmitted to the cloud via **Wi-Fi**, and users can view the status remotely.
- Users receive alerts when the water level is too low or too high.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Motor Control via Blynk**
- Users can manually **turn ON/OFF** the water pump **via the Blynk app**.
- A **relay module** is connected to NodeMCU to control the pump.
- The user can press a button in the app to **activate/deactivate the relay**, controlling the pump accordingly.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Automatic Pump Activation (Optional Feature)**
- If the water level is too low, the system **automatically turns ON** the pump.
- If the tank is full, the system **automatically turns OFF** the pump to prevent overflow.
- This feature can be modified in the code based on user preferences.

## üì° Connectivity & Communication
- **Ultrasonic Sensor ‚Üí NodeMCU**: Measures water level and sends data
- **NodeMCU ‚Üí Blynk Cloud**: Sends water level data to Blynk
- **Blynk Cloud ‚Üí Mobile App**: Displays real-time water level
- **Blynk App ‚Üí NodeMCU**: Controls the pump (relay module)
- **NodeMCU ‚Üí Relay ‚Üí Water Pump**: Controls pump operation based on commands

## üîç Example Scenarios
| Scenario | Water Level (%) | LED Indication | Motor Action |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Very Low | 0-20% | 1 LED ON | Motor ON |
| Low | 21-40% | 2 LEDs ON | Motor ON |
| Medium | 41-60% | 3 LEDs ON | No Action |
| High | 61-80% | 4 LEDs ON | No Action |
| Full | 81-100% | 5 LEDs ON | Motor OFF |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide
- **No Water Level Reading?**
  - Check the ultrasonic sensor connections.
  - Ensure the trigger and echo pins are correctly assigned.
  - Restart NodeMCU and re-upload the code.

- **Blynk App Not Updating?**
  - Check Wi-Fi credentials.
  - Ensure NodeMCU is connected to the internet.
  - Verify the correct Blynk virtual pins are used.

- **Motor Not Turning ON/OFF?**
  - Check relay module wiring.
  - Ensure the relay is receiving the correct signal from NodeMCU.
  - Test motor operation manually before automation.
