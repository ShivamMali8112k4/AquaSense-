# 📝 Notes on SmartWaterMonitor Project

## 📌 Important Points
- The **SmartWaterMonitor** uses an **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)** to measure water levels.
- **NodeMCU ESP8266** is responsible for data processing and communication with **Blynk Cloud**.
- **LED indicators** show different water levels for quick visual feedback.
- The **Relay Module** controls the motor, which can be switched ON/OFF via the **Blynk app**.

## 📚 Required Libraries
- **ESP8266WiFi**
- **BlynkSimpleEsp8266**
- **BlynkTimer**
- **ArduinoJson**
- **LiquidCrystal_I2C**

---

## ⚙️ Hardware Considerations
- **Power Supply:** Ensure that NodeMCU gets a stable **5V power supply**.
- **Sensor Placement:** Place the **HC-SR04 sensor** at the correct height for accurate readings.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Ensure **strong Wi-Fi signal** for uninterrupted Blynk communication.
- **Relay Module:** Use an appropriate **relay rated for your motor’s voltage and current**.

---

## 🖥️ Software Considerations
- Use **Arduino IDE** with **ESP8266 board support** installed.
- Modify the **Wi-Fi credentials** and **Blynk Auth Token** before uploading.

---

## 🚀 Best Practices
- **Test sensor readings** before finalizing the setup.
- **Use serial debugging** to troubleshoot any issues.
- **Check relay operation** manually before integrating with NodeMCU.
- **Keep connections secure** to avoid loose wiring issues.

---

## ⚡ Troubleshooting
- **No Data in Blynk App?**
  - Check Wi-Fi connection.
  - Verify Blynk virtual pin assignments.
- **Incorrect Water Level Readings?**
  - Reposition the ultrasonic sensor.
  - Ensure the sensor is free from obstructions.
- **Motor Not Turning ON/OFF?**
  - Check relay wiring and power supply.
  - Ensure the relay is correctly triggered by NodeMCU.

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements
- Implement **automatic motor activation** based on water level.
- Add **LoRaWAN/MQTT integration** for remote monitoring.
- Store data logs in **Google Sheets/Firebase**.
